# HaikuGenerator
App that can generate a haiku based on a given seed.

This project is a work in progress with the following intended goals:
1) Create a method for converting text to and from phonemes
2) Research to see if an RNN is capable of learning concepts like syllables when passed phonemes
3) Determine if an RNN can still learn english from a corpus of phonemes

Note: That the purpose of the project is centered around methods for handling phonemes. Although it would be nice to produce believable haikus, it is not a requirement.
